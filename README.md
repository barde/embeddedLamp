Connection Hint for Working at Home
---------------------------------

1. Open a Console
2. Connect to *vpn.selbstapotheose.de* on port 7788 as user panda, i.e.
`ssh -p 7788 panda@vpn.selbstapotheose.de`
3. Password is known for users of the project(see eMails)
4. You can now access the */sys/class/gpio* files and try out using the LED as blinking debug port

Kernel sources and compiler are on the system.
