\section{C Application wlan\_info.c}

The initial choice was to write an application in C and use the \textit{iwlib} library provided by the \textit{Wireless Tools} project \footnote{\url{http://www.hpl.hp.com/personal/Jean_Tourrilhes/Linux/Tools.html}}. It is funded by \textit{Hewlett Packard} and available as Open Source software. Furthermore, it also includes applications for getting data about wireless hardware and information about wireless networks.

The application consists of two files: \textit{wlan\_info.c} and \textit{wlan\_info.h}. The latter is being included right at the beginning of \textit{wlan\_info.c}. The only thing the header file does is to include some libraries (like the math library and the aforementioned \textit{iwlib}). The C file includes the actual logic of the program which is diveded into three functions: 



\begin{lstlisting}[language=bash]
$ gcc wlan_info.c -Wall -o wlan_info -L. -liw -lm
